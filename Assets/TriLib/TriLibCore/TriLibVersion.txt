Version Notes:
The "Map" method from MaterialMapper is executed in parallel Threads now.
If you want to call a code in the Main Thread from this method, use the "Dispatcher.InvokeAsyncAndWait" method.
Keep in mind that your called method must implement the "TriLibCore.Interfaces.IAwaitable" to indicate when the method task is complete.

Version Notes:
Since TriLib 2.0.12, the 'SFB' namespace has been replaced by the 'TriLibCore.SFB' namespace to avoid conflicts with the vanilla StandaloneFileBrowser.
To fix errors related to the 'SFB' namespace, replace the 'SFB' namespace from your code with the 'TriLibCore.SFB' namespace.
If you need any guidance, send a message to 'contato@ricardoreis.net'.
